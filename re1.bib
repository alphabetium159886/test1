abstract = {Based on antiparallel asymmetric double δ-magnetic-barrier semiconductor microstructure constructed on the surface of GaAs/Al1-xGaxAs heterostructure by patterning two ferromagnetic stripes, an electron-momentum filter was proposed recently. We further explore the effect of a δ-potential realized by the atomic-layer doping technique on this filter device. It is shown that this filter is sensitive to the δ-potential because the effective potential experienced by electrons in the device depends on the δ-potential. It is also shown that both magnitude and sign of wave-vector filtering efficiency can be tuned by adjusting weight or position of the δ-potential. Therefore, a controllable electron-momentum filter may be obtained for nanoelectronics device applications.}

abstract = {The solution of the Schrödinger–Wannier equation is examined for the potential that is defined as a sum of the two delta functions of unequal strengths. The analytical expression for the transmission coefficient is derived from the solution. The transmission coefficient is shown to exhibit maxima and minima. Moreover, it is proved that the transmission coefficient in its maxima is larger and in its minima is smaller than the transmission coefficient for the corresponding single delta-function potential. Some differences between the transmission coefficient of particles with the quadratic energy spectrum and the transmission coefficient of particles with the Kane energy spectrum are presented.}
